 * @file periodicDataReading.ino
 * @brief Read ambient temperature (C/F) and relative humidity (%RH) in cycle read mode.
 * @details Experimental phenomenon: Before we start, please set the read frequency and repeatability of the read
 * @n (the difference between the data measured by the chip under the same measurement conditions),
 * and enter the periodic read mode, and then read the temperature and humidity data.
 * @n The temperature and humidity data will be printed at the serial port, after 10 seconds of operation.
 * @n It will exit the cycle mode and enter 2 measurement mode: Single measurement mode and Cycle measurement mode.
 * @n Single measurement mode: reflect the difference between the two modes of reading data.
 * @n Cycle measurement mode: the chip periodically monitors temperature and humidity, only in this mode the ALERT pin will work.
